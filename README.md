    d. otherwise it is fail.

    Test Data : 
    Input the Roll Number of the student :784 
    Input the marks of Physics, Chemistry and Computer Application : 70 80 90

    Expected Output :
    Roll No : 784 
    Marks in Physics : 70 
    Marks in Chemistry : 80 
    Marks in Computer Application : 90 
    Total Marks = 240 
    Percentage = 80.00 
    Division = First
